* Notes
** Database display
fltk has an example file, ~table-spread.cxx~ which implements functionality
similar to what I want to be able to modify data in the sqlite database.
** Trace list
fltk ~Fl_Tree~ is basically what I want. It even uses shift+click to select
multiple nodes. And ~tree-custom-draw-items.cxx~ shows how to draw little custom
graphics on the nodes (preview option? or custom symbol for data type?).

** Misc

*** Open web browser
~menubar-add~ opens a browser and goes to google on selecting help->google. Nifty.

*** Open/Save files
~nativefilechooser-simple-app~
